Hey Guys . First post . Pretty Exciting . This post is about setting up your very own github blog like me and then you can also post your steps to set up your github blog . (F**cking recursive posts).

## List Of Steps

1. Create an empty git repository with the name as username.github.io and initialize it . 
2. Put a sample hello_world kind of html inside the repo as index.html and you can access it as <username>.github.io/index.html . It works !!! . You have your own place in the big ass network.
3. Install jekyll . pretty easy shit (though the whole thing is easy) . Anyway create a new jekyll project as  jekyll new .
